The Twonky UPnP server for Linux is available for different
machine architectures:

-  Standard PC (x86)
-  ARM (Advanced Risc Machine) big and little endian 
-  MIPS (Microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages)
   big and little endian
-  PowerPC (Performance optimization with enhanced RISC Performance Chip)
-  SH3 (Hitachi SH)
-  SH4 (Hitachi SH)
-  SPARC (Scalable Processor ARChitecture)

Your package will consist of the following files:

twonkystarter				Twonky UPnP server starter
twonkyserver				Twonky UPnP server
twonkywebdav				Twonky WebDAV server (to support content sync for mobile devices) 
twonkywebdavfolderconfig.xml		Configuration file for Twonky WebDAV
twonkywebdavuserconfig.xml		Configuration file for Twonky WebDAV
twonkyproxy				Twonky proxy module (to allow access to online resources - my.twonky.com)
cgi-bin/*				cgi scripts for twonky
plugins/*				plugins for twonky
resources/*				resources for twonky
radio.m3u				Sample playlist
Linux-HowTo.txt				This file
TS_7.0_Release_Notes.pdf		Release notes
Terms of Use*.pdf			Licence Agreement
twonky.sh				Sample autostart script
twonkyserver-default.ini		Default configuration for Twonky Server

Copy all files (keeping the directory structure) into your most 
favourite installation directory, e.g. /usr/local/twonky.

Make sure that the server file, plugins and the cgi scripts have the exe bit set.
If not, try:
"chmod 700 twonkys* twonkyproxy twonkywebdav cgi-bin/* plugins/*"
Eventually it is necessary to have a multicast route set for the
server by issuinge, e.g.:
"route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0"

If you are running a Debian distribution on a 64 bit architecture, it
is possible that you need to install the 32 bit compatibility
libraries. In this case invoke:
"apt-get install ia32-libs"

Twonky needs an "appdata" folder to store its database and other runtime generated 
files. The default location for this depends on the user running the server. For
the user root (id = 0) this is

/var/twonky

For all other users this is

$HOME/.twonky

To specify an alternate location for the "appdata" use the command line swtich 

-appdata "/<PATH TO APPDATA FOLDER>"

The specified path needs to be full qualified, do not use relative paths here.

In any case make sure that this folder exists and is writable before starting the 
server.

Now start the server with a full qualified path (never just "./twonkystarter"),
but "/usr/local/twonky/twonkystarter" . The server will display a startup
message. The server is running now and you can find and use it with
your UPnP client device. Before you continue, you should point the
server to one or more content directories via the configuration
web-page, unless the content is available from subdirectories of the
server' working directory.

To open the server's configuration web-page, open the following url in a web 
browser:

http://127.0.0.1:9000/webconfig


If the server can not be found by the client device check your
firewall settings.

To enable autostart of the server, you need to be a Linux expert,
because all Linux flavours differ and no general procedure can be
suggested. In many cases "twonky.sh" could be adapted to your
needs and linked into an appropriate location to enable autostart. The
script is intended to work on SUSE, OpenSUSE, Fedora Core and other
Linux Standard Base (LSB) compliant systems when installed into
/etc/init.d and linked to rc3.d and rc5.d as S99twonkyserver and
K99twonkyserver:
"ln s ../twonky.sh S99twonkyserver"
"ln s ../twonky.sh K99twonkyserver"

Please note:
twonkywebdav and twonkyproxy are no longer utomatically started by twonkystarter. 
They are now started directly by the init script twonky.sh. If you are using an alternate 
method of starting twonkyserver, you also need to use that to start 
twonkywebdav and twonkyproxy.

Known issue:

The installer script (twonky*.sh) is not working for modern ubuntu linux
systems due to incompatibitlities with some system config tools (chkconfig 
vs. update-rc.d). The manual installation however is unaffected.
